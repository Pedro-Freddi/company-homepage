          <p>I was very impressed with the exhibition! The guided tour is educative, the art pieces are beautiful and the gift shop is great. I will definitely come back soon with my family!</p>

          <h3 class="review-title">It's great and all... but watch out for the monkey</h3>
          <p>The gallery is organized and clean. The art is top notch and very distinct. However you have to be careful with your food; the monkey kept stealing my son's snacks! I had to leave early because he wouldn't stop crying.</p>

          <h3 class="review-title">I'm in love with the intern!</h3>
          <p>The tour was so good, very educative and the art is amazing. Loved the food in the restaurant, even though the monkey kept watching my plate. The staff's intern is the cutest thing you'll ever meet, I'm completely in love!</p>

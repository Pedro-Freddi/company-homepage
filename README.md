# Company Homepage Project

This project is part of **Codecademy's Full Stack Engineering Path's** challenge projects.

The objective was to build a simple homepage for a real or imagined company using the *Flexible Box (Flexbox)* layout tool. So I decided to create a homepage for the fictional Truly Wild Art Gallery, an art gallery ran entirely by animals. All images were taken from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). 

The webpage is fully responsive (resize the browser to check it out) and was tested with different screen sizes. Media queries were used to make minor adjustments for the smaller screens, but the main content was made responsive only with Flexbox.

It was a fun project and a great practice for laying out items with Flexbox.
